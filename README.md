# Simon-Game
The Simon game is a classic memory game where players must replicate a sequence of lights and sounds generated by the game. This version is implemented using HTML , CSS , and jQuery . Players follow the sequence and attempt to advance through increasingly difficult levels by remembering and repeating longer sequences accurately.
